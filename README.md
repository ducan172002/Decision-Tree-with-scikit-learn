About the Connect-4 dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
This dataset contains all legal 8-ply positions in the game of Connect-4 in which neither player has 
won yet, and in which the next move is not forced. There are 67557 samples, each of which is 
characterized by 42 attributes (each corresponding to one connect-4 square) and classified to win,
